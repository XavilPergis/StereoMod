# Ideas

- renewable non-renewables (like netherrack, currently has no way of being automated)
- UI in furnaces to show stored XP
- Freecam
- Mechanic to indicate presence of nearby unlit caves, useful for mob farms and such
- game internals visualization (structure bounding boxes, hidden entity stats, etc.)
- prevent use of tools that are almost broken, so accidents cant happen :)
- shulker box improvments (capacity, restocking, automatic filling, making block picking work with shulker boxes)
- 360 degree 3rd person view in boats

- better tool crafting system
    - encourage tool longevity - tools should be upgradeable, and things you keep around for very long periods of time. tools should reflect your preferences and the labor your put into them.
    - specialized tool niches
    - no overall "best" tool. avoid eg pickaxes having a best material (netherite) and best enchantments
    - theming - hard magic?
    - reinforcing orthogonal systems

# Completed
- adjustable day length
- potion stacking


# Magic System
- Magic is accessible by anyone, an innate property of all beings, including animals and plants.
- Mind & Body are unified; no seperation or distinction between reality and ideals
    - could be either material (focus on reality, where thought is encompassed by reality) or ideal (focus on ideals, where reality is encompassed by thought). reality creates minds vs minds create reality.
    - deities at the crossroads, able to integrate both. deeply connected with and partially are the universe.
